##HangmanClient
This project is based on an assignment1, Network programming with JAVA.
 
###Objectives
To develop a distributed (client/server or peer-to-peer) application, i.e. define tasks, assign tasks to processes and develop an application-specific communication protocol for process interaction using UDP or/and TCP sockets;

###Task
To solve in Java following problems.

1- Addressing: IP-addresses and port numbers, which are needed for communication, must be given as input parameters to your application via command-line arguments or/and via (G)UI, if any. All needed IP addresses and port numbers must have default values (e.g. "127.0.0.1" or "localhost", port 80) used in the case if they are not given as input parameters.

2- Multithreading: At the server side, use a separate thread for each client connected; At the client side, use separate threads for (G)UI and communication.

The project uses JavaFX GUI for cleint and ant command prompt project for the server.

###Problem: Hangman Game
To develop a client-server distributed application in Java for a guessing game similar to the "Hangman" game (see a description in Wikipedia).
